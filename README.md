# GymLog
"Gym Log" is an on going personal project started by Zachary Balaska.  Its purpose is to allow users to store their own personal workout schedule, locate gyms using Google Maps, and link up with other users.  Users are able to like and dislike one another's comments which contributes to their overall karma-like system score called "Power Level".
